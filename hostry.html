history of the city
A Saudi city known as the Bride of the South, famous for its moderate climate and the diversity of its tourist attractions. It was chosen as the capital of Arab tourism in 2017, and it is the first Saudi city to receive this title.
 
Label:
Abha was known in the old days - according to the circulating accounts - as "Abqa", which is the site from which the camel Bilqis, the Queen of Sheba, carried gifts to the Prophet Solomon, peace be upon him. Later, her name was changed to "Abha". Its inhabitants call it "the kingdom of mountains and the home of imagination."
 
the site:
The city is located in the southwest of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It is the administrative capital of the Emirate and the Asir region, which extends from the borders of the Jazan region in the southwest to the borders of Yemen in the southeast and Najran in the east, and from the borders of the Riyadh region in the north to the Al-Baha region on the Red Sea in the west.
It is located on the Hijaz Mountains, between the governorates of Khamis Mushait (from the north and northeast), Al Namas Governorate (from the northwest), and Mahayel Governorate (from the west and southwest).

Population:
The population of Abha is estimated at about 371,000 people, according to the General Authority for Statistics in Saudi Arabia.

Space:
It covers an area of about five thousand hectares, rises about 2,200 meters above sea level, and is surrounded by mountains on most sides.

the climate:
The city of Abha has a moderate climate in most of the year, and it gets very cold during the winter, and it is considered one of the regions most exposed to rainfall in Saudi Arabia.

At the beginning of 2017, the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs in Saudi Arabia classified 29 cities as high-risk if exposed to heavy rains, including the city of Abha.

The ministry said - in a statement carried by the Saudi press - that these cities have characteristics in terms of the amount of rain, the topography of the land and the number of residents.
touristic city:
The city of Abha represents the main entrance to the Asir National Park, which extends from the sea to the highest mountain peak in the Kingdom, and is distinguished by the diversity of life in it, its resorts and its tourist facilities, including the hanging wagons that reach the top of Jabal al-Soudah or the hanging village with its impregnable fortress, rocky cliffs, and a wonderful resort.

And the city of Abha launched celebrations in late April 2017, choosing it as the capital of Arab tourism, due to its diverse tourism and heritage capabilities
